# Glee-fully universe map release validation

## Implemented

The nine generated detail diagrams cover all 60 indexed page URLs. The three-brand overview links visitors to the sibling universe pages. Catalog status comes from the existing publication-state function. Historical concepts are preserved in `docs/archive/universe-concept-map-2026-09-06.md` without claiming they are active or complete.

Index writes invoke the adapter. Both release jobs regenerate index, portfolio statistics, index, and cache tokens before validation or exact-byte artifact comparison. Repeated complete generation was verified to preserve the index, public provenance, universe page, and offline worker bytes.

## Local evidence

- Portable generator: 13 regression tests passed.
- Integration: 6 regression tests passed (addition/removal, idempotency, malformed-input preservation, marker safety, feedback exclusion, trailing-slash origin).
- Public artifact tests: 12 tests, 11 passed and one platform-specific case skipped on Windows.
- Existing reconciliation: 3 tests passed; client regressions passed.
- Site validator: 63 pages, zero issues and warnings.
- Link checker: zero broken links; 60 sitemap URLs.
- CSP, cache freshness, search freshness, map freshness, portfolio statistics, action policy, accent contrast, and dark-coverage checks passed.
- Browser acceptance: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit each passed 390px/light and 1440px/dark, all nine diagrams, 60 page destinations, focusable SVG links, and no document overflow or uncaught page errors.
- All three engines also passed no-JavaScript outline and blocked-Mermaid fallback checks.
- Local HTTP browser fixtures remove only CSP upgrade-insecure-requests from the served response so WebKit can use a loopback HTTP server; production policy is unchanged.
- Visual inspection confirmed readable dark-mode branch labels and explicit beta/unavailable status.
- Installed core package files match the canonical Skillz package byte-for-byte.

GitHub checks, merge revision, and public deployment are recorded in the pull request and its release workflow. This file records local evidence and does not claim those later steps have already completed.
