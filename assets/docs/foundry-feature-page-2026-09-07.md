# Glee-fully FoundRy feature page

Reviewed: 2026-09-07

## Result and scope

`/foundry/` introduces the Glee-fully FoundRy on its parent public storefront.
Homepage and Showcase calls to action, site search, sitemap and the generated
Universe directory make it discoverable. This change adds one supporting page:
64 production HTML files and 61 indexable pages, with the existing catalog of
seven branches and 42 Tool-ettes unchanged.

Only the Glee-fully storefront is changed. The page is an explanation of the
private local pilot. It does not host the builder, receive project records or
announce a public application launch.

## Structure and brand

The owner supplied [OverKill's Found-Ry feature page](https://overkillhill.com/projects/found-ry/)
as an information-structure reference: purpose, problem, working process,
outputs, current availability, principles, relationships, roadmap and FAQs.
The Glee-fully page uses original copy grounded in its own workbench. OverKill's
product claims, public app embed, nine-station workflow and visual design were
not imported.

The existing [Glee-fully parent site](https://glee-fully.tools/) supplies the
visual language and shell. The implementation reuses `glee-main`,
`glee-hero-card`, `stripe-bg`, the Glee breadcrumb, cards, grids, buttons,
butterfly artwork, header, footer and theme controls. Fredoka/Poppins headings,
Open Sans body text, warm paper, teal and coral come from the existing
`assets/css/theme.css`, whose contents are unchanged. No new dependencies,
custom stylesheets, inline styles or page-specific JavaScript were added.

## Capability and availability statements

The workbench implementation supports four project types, saved local drafts,
components and references, recorded acceptance evidence, readiness checks,
archive/restore and JSON, Markdown and ZIP packages. Its web-tool export is a
working record-list starter, not a general application generator.

The page distinguishes a recorded observation from independently verified
behavior, generated packages from deployed tools, and proposed improvements
from implemented features. The mentor relationship is reciprocal; Skillz is
the shared skill catalog, while the regional workbenches retain their own
purpose and records. Canonical private content is not copied onto this page.

## Validation evidence

- Site validator: 64 pages, zero issues and zero warnings.
- Internal link and sitemap audit: zero broken links; 61 sitemap URLs and no
  file/sitemap mismatches. External link availability is not certified.
- CSP verification: all 64 production pages pass.
- Strict accent contrast: zero advisories and zero branded-hover failures.
- Existing dark-surface coverage check passes.
- Search index, portfolio statistics and stylesheet version checks pass.
- Static resilience checks pass; this is not a full network or cross-browser test.
- Browser checks at 320, 375, 390, 414, 768, 1024, 1280 and 1440 pixels found no
  horizontal overflow, broken images or duplicate primary headings.
- Sampled desktop/mobile light and dark renders, hero anchor navigation,
  keyboard-operable FAQs, mobile navigation and FoundRy search results pass.
  No browser warning or error entries appeared in the sampled session.

The many existing HTML changes are primarily generated CSP meta hashes for the
new page's structured metadata. Search, Universe directory, sitemap, page-count
statistics and offline cache version were refreshed with existing scripts.
The explicit public-artifact page-directory allowlist includes `foundry`, so
the existing deployment package includes the new route.

## Publication and next steps

The review branch is not evidence of production deployment. After the normal
pull-request checks and owner review, publish through the existing Pages
workflow and smoke-test `/foundry/`, both inbound calls to action and search on
the live domain. Validate each workbench package type on a real Glee-fully task
before strengthening the page's maturity claims. Add a public launch link or
embed only when an actual access route and its operating model exist.
