## Defects fixed in this pass

| Page | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `toolbox/02-treasured-finds/02b-decor-detective/index.html` | Missing `<!DOCTYPE html>` and the file opened with `<html lang="en">` directly. Same regression class as `02e-spirited-journal` (caught in 2026-05-02 audit). | Prepended the missing DOCTYPE. Validator will now fail loud if any page regresses. |

## Re-running this audit

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-site.py
```

Exit code is `0` when the site is clean, `1` when any page has a critical issue
(missing DOCTYPE / title / canonical / theme-color / favicon / manifest, broken
JSON-LD, or canonical pointing to the homepage from a non-homepage file).
