      <h1>Meet Glee & Jamie</h1>
      <p>Glee-fully was born in a small Texas kitchen — between one chai latte and the next — as an experiment to see if AI could be both useful and kind. Glee brought the warmth, color, and intuition. Jamie brought the structure, precision, and polish. Together, they made something human: Custom GPTs that organize your world without stealing your soul.</p>
      <h2>About Glee</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Yakima, Washington, Glee carries the rhythm of the Pacific Northwest — grunge playlists, coffeehouse afternoons, and a love of everything Stevie Nicks. She’s a master of details and a curator of cozy order. Her chai mug is always nearby, and so is her joy.</p>
      <h2>About Jamie</h2>
      <p>Jamie spent decades building systems in the lumber and construction world before discovering the creative precision of GPT design. He’s the engineer who thinks in metaphors — building frameworks that feel like poetry in code.</p>
      <h2>The Spark</h2>
      <p>Glee’s curiosity met Jamie’s architecture, and the result was Glee-fully — an entire suite of GPTs that organize life with warmth and precision. Because technology should reflect the humans who use it.</p>
