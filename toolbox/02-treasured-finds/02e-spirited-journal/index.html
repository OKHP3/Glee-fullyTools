        <p class="hero-subtitle">
          Spirited Journal is the “heart notes” Twig under Glee‑fully Treasured Finds. It doesn’t
          just log what you own — it captures why it matters, when it showed up in your life, and
          where it lives now. Think of it as a memory‑keeper that speaks the same language as your
          Treasured Finds inventory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of scattered sticky notes and half‑finished scrapbook pages, you get tidy,
          repeatable entries you can search, sort, and reuse — all tuned to the Glee‑fully Toolbox
          structure you’re already using.

      <!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
      <section class="content-section container">
        <header class="section-header">
          <h2>What this Tool‑ette does</h2>
          <p class="note">
            Spirited Journal adds the “why this matters” layer on top of your Treasured Finds
            inventory — so your shelves and bins aren’t just organized, they’re remembered.
          </p>
        </header>

        <h3>Core purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The core job of Spirited Journal is simple: turn quick notes about a book, candle, décor
          bin, or keepsake into a clear, cozy story you can come back to later. It aligns each
          entry with your Treasured Finds structure, so every memory can point back to a collection,
          category, or specific item.
        </p>

        <h3>Best for</h3>
        <p>
          Great for sentimental collectors, home organizers, and memory‑keepers who don’t want
          their stories trapped in their head. Perfect when you catch yourself thinking, “I should
          write down why we bought this before I forget,” or when you’re building a record your
          future self — or your kids — can actually follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s especially helpful if you already use Glee‑fully Treasured Finds for tracking
          books, candles, décor, gifts, or craft supplies and you’re ready to layer in the human
          side of the data.
        </p>

        <h3>Inputs &amp; outputs</h3>
        <p>
          You can start as small or as nerdy as you like. Typical inputs include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short bullets about where you found something and why you kept it.</li>
          <li>
            A list exported or copied from Treasured Finds (titles, scent names, bins, shelves).
          </li>
          <li>
            Loose paragraphs about a trip, holiday, or shopping run where you picked up multiple
            items.
          </li>
          <li>
            Descriptions of photos: “Picture of the bookshelf from our first apartment” or “The
            Halloween bin with the ghost pillow.”
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Spirited Journal turns those into:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Structured journal entries with fields like <em>Item</em>, <em>Story</em>, <em>When</em>,
            <em>Where</em>, <em>With Who</em>, <em>Season / Holiday</em>, and <em>Home location</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Summary tables you can paste into Treasured Finds, Notion, Google Sheets, or a physical
            journal layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional “story snapshots” that give you a quick paragraph you can reuse in scrapbooks,
            social posts, or family updates.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- CORE FUNCTIONS (LEAVES) -->
      <section class="content-section container">
        <header class="section-header">
          <h2>Core functions (Leaves)</h2>
          <p class="note">
            Each Leaf is a repeatable pattern — a way Spirited Journal can take over the tedious
            part so you can stay in the memories.
          </p>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>FUNCTION⚙️ (Leaf) – Single‑Item Story Builder:</strong>
            Start with one object — a favorite candle, a signed book, a weird little thrifted owl —
            and get a structured entry with prompts for how, when, and why it came home with you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FUNCTION⚙️ (Leaf) – Trip &amp; Holiday Recap:</strong>
            Feed in a short description of a trip, holiday, or season and let the GPT help you map
            the items tied to that moment — gifts, décor, souvenirs, and media — into one
            cohesive story.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FUNCTION⚙️ (Leaf) – Prompted Memory Shake‑Loose:</strong>
            When details feel fuzzy, Spirited Journal walks you through gentle questions to jog
            your memory: who was there, what you were celebrating, what it smelled like, and how it
            made you feel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FUNCTION⚙️ (Leaf) – Story‑to‑Structure Export:</strong>
            Takes rich narrative entries and condenses them into tidy tables that match Treasured
            Finds fields — ready to paste into your main collection log without rewriting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FUNCTION⚙️ (Leaf) – Tagging &amp; Cross‑linking Helper:</strong>
            Suggests tags and cross‑links back to your Tools and other Tool‑ettes (books vs.
            candles vs. décor vs. gifts) so each story can be pulled up from multiple angles later.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- WHY NOT VANILLA CHATGPT -->
      <section class="content-section container">
        <header class="section-header">
          <h2>Why use this instead of vanilla ChatGPT?</h2>
          <p class="note">
            You could ask a blank chat to help you journal. Spirited Journal just starts where
            you’re already standing — inside the Glee‑fully Toolbox.
          </p>
        </header>

        <h3>Pre‑tuned brain</h3>
        <p>
          Spirited Journal arrives pre‑loaded with the assumptions of a real collector’s home. It
          understands that “Treasure” can mean open candles, half‑read series, bins in the attic,
          and carefully hidden gifts. It expects things like shelves, totes, digital libraries, and
          wishlists, and it leans on standard fields and phrasing so you don’t have to re‑explain
          your world every single session.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tone‑wise, it’s warm but not saccharine — think “friend who loves your stuff as much as
          you do,” not “relentless motivational poster.”
        </p>

        <h3>Suite‑aware &amp; ecosystem‑ready</h3>
        <p>
          This Tool‑ette knows it’s a Twig under Glee‑fully Treasured Finds. It’s designed to play
          nicely with your other helpers in that branch — book and media tracking, candle and scent
          logs, décor and bin mapping, gift stashes, and craft inventory.
        </p>

        <p>
          When it suggests structure, tags, or next steps, it does so in a way that makes sense
          across the full Treasured Finds Tool, not just inside one chat window. That means less
          copy‑paste chaos and fewer “where did I put that?” dead ends.
        </p>

        <h3>Repeatable, export‑friendly workflows</h3>
        <p>
          Vanilla ChatGPT will happily spit out a nice paragraph — once. Spirited Journal is built
          to be reused. It leans on clear patterns you can run again and again: same columns,
          similar prompts, predictable output that drops cleanly into docs, sheets, or printable
          pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, you end up with a lightweight personal archive: not just what you own, but
          why it mattered in that season of your life.
        </p>

      <!-- GETTING STARTED -->

        <header class="section-header">
          <h2>Getting started</h2>
          <p class="note">
            You don’t need a whole‑house project to start. One shelf, one bin, or one weekend is
            plenty for a first pass.
          </p>
        </header>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1 – Pick a tiny slice.</strong>
            Choose one cluster to start with: a single book stack, a candle tray, one holiday bin,
            or a “we bought a lot that weekend” trip. Tell Spirited Journal what slice you’re
            focusing on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2 – Paste or type your raw notes.</strong>
            Drop in a rough list (“3 fall candles, 2 throws, ghost pillow, metal pumpkin sign”) or
            paste rows from your Treasured Finds log. Don’t worry about grammar or order — messy is
            fine; that’s its job.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3 – Choose a mode.</strong>
            Say what you want out of this run: “single‑item stories,” “trip recap,” or “holiday
            overview.” Spirited Journal will adjust prompts and structure to match.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 4 – Save what matters.</strong>
            Copy the finished entries or tables into your Treasured Finds Tool, your notes app, or
            a printable format. Tag them with where they live so the next time you’re sorting or
            packing, the story is one click away.

        <p>
          Glee‑fully Treasured Finds is the branch for everything you collect and love — books,
          candles, seasonal décor, crafts, gifts, and the little things that make home feel like
          yours. It keeps track of what you own, where it lives, and what you’re still hunting for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Spirited Journal plugs directly into that system by giving each item or cluster a
          story‑first record you can point back to from your inventory.
